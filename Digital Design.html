          For this assignment I was required to create a movie or tv show poster using Adobe Photoshop.I choose the tv show Euphoria because it was being aired in the same time 
          frame as the class. I then choose a background colour gradient going from blue to purple in an upwards direction. I then looked on Unsplash for a picture of a teenage girl 
          because that is who narrates the show and who's perspective we see. After I found one I imported it into Photoshop and added liquify and Motion Blur. I also added some text 
          to give the audience some context for what my design was portraying.

          For this assignment I was required to create a series of social media tiles to promote a song using Adobe Illustrator. I chose Sunflower by Post Malone because it has emotional 
          lyrics and refernces different colours. The first thing I did was select which lyrics I was going to use. Once I'd done that the next thing I did was match fonts I'd 
          chosen with specific lyrics. After that I selected different coloured background's depending on if the lyrics were happy or sad. I then applied different effects to the text <br> 
          including tilting, bolding, fliping and rounding until I was happy with my designs.

          For this assignment I was required to select and research a crowd funding business and write a mission statement for the brand. The brand I selected was a perfume company 
          called Eauso Vert who were on a mission to bring clean luxury to the fragrance category. Once I selected my brand I decided on the their tone of voice and some keywords to describe them. 
          I then wrote a misson statement which was "To create unique and honest, zero waste fragrances for the new generation." After that I decided on demographics
          and psychographics for the brand. I then researched competitors to Eauso Vert which included Masion Margiela and Byredo. I then came up with a moodboard which mostly 
          compromised of green gardens and spaces. After all of this research had been done I then started sketching some concept ideas for the logo. I orginally included a perfume 
          bottle in the logo but then realised that the logo was going onto a perfume bottle and that it would look wrong. I choose to create a dodecahedron because it was the shape 
          that most closely resembled Earth. I also traced countries using vectors to add some identifable features to the globe so that the audience knew that what was they were
          looking at. I then adjusted the logo to the minimum size it could be and added clear space around it.
