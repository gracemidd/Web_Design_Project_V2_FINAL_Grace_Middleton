      For this assignment I was required to study a current website design I choose which was Green Cup who are a health food store with several locations around Melbourne. <br>
      I then had to analyse and evaluate its functionality in which I found that the Green Cup website had a photo with its brand name cut off, their was no information about what <br>
      the brand do or sell and the addresses of the stores had different alignments to the suburb names above them. I then conducted observations and interviews with four people 
      who varyed in age about what things they found difficult and challenging with the website and also some general questions about internet habits. After that I came up with <br>
      2 persona's of who would use this website. I then proposed a colour palette and a font that would be used as well as some mock up pages including a landing page and a reviews page.

      For this assignment I was required to develop a sitemap and two user journeys that demonstrate the design of the UX project proposed in assessment 1. For the sitemap I decided to have a landing page and also a menu page, an about us page, a contact us page and a reviews page.  
      
      The user journeys are to be based on the personas
      identified in assessment 1. The user journeys should indicate how
      they align to the personas. Students will present their sitemap and
      user journey as a user testing session in class. During the user
      testing session, students are required to give and receive feedback
      on each otherâ€™s work.
