      For this assignment I was required to study a current website design I choose which was Green Cup who are a health food store with several locations around Melbourne. <br>
      I then had to then analyse and evaluate its functionality. I found that the Green Cup website had a photo with its brand name cut off, their was no information about what the brand do or sell and the addresses of the stores have different alignments to the suburb names above them
      
      user experience, and
      aesthetics. Students will conduct surveys, interviews, and
      observations in order to identify a UX issue. Then, based on their
      user research, students are required to develop a solution for the
      UX and UI design webpage and propose a UX website design
      concept.
