      For this assignment I was required to study a current website design I choose which was Green Cup who are a health food store with several locations around Melbourne. <br>
      I then had to analyse and evaluate its functionality in which I found that the Green Cup website had a photo with its brand name cut off, their was no information about what <br>
      the brand do or sell and the addresses of the stores had different alignments to the suburb names above them. I then conducted observations and interviews with four people 
      who varyed in age about what things they found difficult and challenging with the website and also some general questions about internet habits. After that I came up with <br>
      2 persona's of who would use this website. I then proposed a colour palette and a font that would be used as well as some mock up pages including a landing page and a reviews page.

      For this assignment I was required to develop a sitemap and two user journeys that demonstrate the design of the UX project proposed in assessment 1. For the sitemap I 
      decided to have a landing page and also a menu page, an about us page, a contact us page and a reviews page. I then created user journey's based on the personas 
      identified in assessment 1. For the first user journey Ava uses Google to find a smoothie store near her, she then looks at the Green Cup website, she then finds Green Cup <br>
      on Uber Eats and decides to order, she then goes to a Green Cup activation event and lastly she takes her friends to Green Cup who have never been before.  For the second 
      user journey Charlotte goes on Instagram and Green Cup comes up as a seggestion. She then Googles Green Cup and looks at some of the reviews. After that she finds 
      Green Cup on Uber Eats and decides to order. She then signs up to email marketing to a discount code and lastly she goes to Green Cup on the weekend with some of her friends.

        <br>
        For this assignment I was required to complete UI prototypes that showed at least 4 key pages of the Green Cup website. These pages were the ones identified in the site <br> 
        map in the previous assignment. I choose to make the menu pages from scratch using pictures that I found on Uber Eats of the products. I felt it was important to include <br>
        the ingredients in the menu as many people have allergies these days. I also had to link my personas to actions which my two users were likely to make on the website. For my first persona Ava she opened the Green Cup website. She then clicked on menu and then smoothies. She then could either DM a friend to meet her at Green Cup or decide which one she wanted and walk to the store and buy it. 
  
  
        <!--least two of the persons identified in previous assessments.
        Students are also required to discuss the research undertaken and a
        rationale for the website design and outline the strength and
        weaknesses of their design and how it has improved on the original
        UX problem. -->
