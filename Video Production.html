  For this assignment I was required to develop a pre production presention for an advertising film for Apple. Originally I wanted to do a ad for the brand Aesop however it 
  was going to be too technically challenging for the limited amount of time I had. I then decided to do a video for Apple because I like using their products and thought it would be fun 
  to make an ad for them. I decided that I wanted the video have be exciting and have a fun and happy direction because that's what it feels like when you use Appple products. 
  The video also needed to have a tagline which was Energise with Apple. I decided that the video needed to have lots of action cut shots and inspiring music.

  For this assignment I was required to create two ten-fifteen second trailers for Apple. The videos needed to act as promotional material for  the Assigment 3 production. <br>
  The first video contained a girl waking up in bed and turning her alarm off on her iPhone. She then goes into the bathroom and uses Siri to set a timer for brushing her teeth. 
  She then sits down at her desk and gets ready for online class. At the end of the video the Apple logo is shown as well as the hashtag #EaseWithApple and link to the Apple 
  website. The concept for the video was to portray what a typical day in the life looks like of someone who uses Apple products.

      For this assignment I was required to create a one minute Youtube pre-roll commerical. I decided that the location for the video was going to be at my house as I didn't 
      have lots of time and it would be easier if I didn't have to change locations. I also wanted to cast myself in the video however after a discussion with my lecturer we 
      decided that I needed to cast someone else as the lead so that I could focus on producing and directing the video. However I ran into a problem which was that my first idea was going to be very technically challening 
      coming up with an inital idea
