<div class="Digital-Photography-Assignment-1-text"> <b> Subject:</b> Digital Photography <br> <b> Assignment Number:</b> 1 <br> <b> Trimester: </b> 2 <br> <b> Year:</b> 2022 <br> <b> Software Used: </b> Nikon D5500 and Adobe Photoshop <br>
  <br>
  For this assignment I was required to photograph a bowl of fruit using a professional camera in different lighting conditions by using studio lights and then edit the images using Adobe software. <br>
  I choose a bowl of fruit because everyone in the class was photographing each other and so I wanted to do something different. I firsly took my photograph using a Nikon D5500 which was 
  positioned on a left angle. I then had a light facing straight on and another light at a right angle. I then imported the photo into Photoshop and found a cloud background to mask the studio 
  background. Once I'd done that I found a photo of the moon and of a plant and masked two different sized fruits with those images. I also added some Colour Balance and Exposure effects to take the yellow out of the photo.
