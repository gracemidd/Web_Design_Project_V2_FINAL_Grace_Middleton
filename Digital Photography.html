<div class="Digital-Photography-Assignment-1-text"> <b> Subject:</b> Digital Photography <br> <b> Assignment Number:</b> 1 <br> <b> Trimester: </b> 2 <br> <b> Year:</b> 2022 <br> <b> Software Used: </b> Nikon D5500 and Adobe Photoshop <br>
  <br>
  For this assignment I was required to photograph a bowl of fruit using a professional camera in different lighting conditions by using studio lights and then edit the images <br>
  using Adobe software. I choose a bowl of fruit because everyone in the class was photographing each other and so I wanted to do something different. I firsly took my 
  photograph using a Nikon D5500 which was positioned on a left angle. I then had a light facing straight on and another light at a right angle. I then imported the photo into 
  Photoshop and found a cloud background to mask the studio background. Once I'd done that I found a photo of the moon and of a plant and masked two different sized fruits 
  with those images. I also added some Colour Balance and Exposure effects to take the yellow out of the photo.

<div class="Digital-Photography-Assignment-2-text">  <b> Subject:</b> Digital Photography <br> <b>Assignment Number:</b> 3 <br> <b> Trimester: </b> 2 <br> <b> Year:</b> 2022 <br> <b> Software Used:</b> Nikon D550 and Adobe Photoshop <br>
  <br>
  For this assignment I was required to capture a photograph that explored visual narrative. I choose to take a photo of an AFL game because their can be many different stories 
  and moments that happen in a game. I used a Nikon D5500 to take the photo and then made some adjustments to it in Photoshop. These included cropping, changing the hue and making Jack Riewolt brighter.
  The photo is of Jack Riewolt who is sitting on the ground and reflecting after the game. This is because the game was a draw and he kicked 5 points meaning that if one of those shots had been a goal his team would have won.

  <br>
  For this assignment I was required to create a series of four promotional photos for Sherrin which are a brand that make AFL balls. I choose them because I wanted to do some modelling in a studio with props.
