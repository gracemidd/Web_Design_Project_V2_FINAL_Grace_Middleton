      For this assignment I was required to make a single page ad for a brand I selected which was Bali Body. I choose them because I used to wear their fake tan all the time. <br>
      I firstly did some research about the company and what types of products they offer. I then needed to find out the demographics for the brand and come up with a 
      psychographic to match. Once I did that I needed to research who their competitors were and do a review of the Bali Body social media channels. I then put together the ad 
      using information I had gathered. I created the ad at home using a Bali Body product I already had. I wanted the image to have bright and fun colours to catch the attention of 
      the target market. The message that I wanted to create was that if you use this tan you will feel confident and that will then transfer into feeling good and having a positive mindset.

      For this assignment I was required to create a visual presentation for a current Australian multi-platform campaign and analysis each campaign medium. The brand I choose 
      was Dyson because I wanted to do some research on their products. I firstly did some research about what beauty products Dyson offer and decided to focus on the Airwrap 
      styler. I then came up with demographics and psychographics for the Dyson hair products. Once I had done that I found the Dyson ads I wanted and started analysing them. 
      The ads were in a magazine, on their Youtube channel and on their Instagram. I then had to find competitors for Dyson which were BaByliss and Remington and then analyse ads on their social media channels.

      For this assignment I was required to develop a multi-media campaign for a brand I selected which was Anine Bing. I firstly did some background research on the company and then 
      came up with demographics and psychographics to match. I then found competitors to Anine Bing which included Pangaia and Sporty and Rich. I then compared how they were different and reviewed their social media messaging, tone and language. 
      After that I made my campaign elements which included print, online and social media.
