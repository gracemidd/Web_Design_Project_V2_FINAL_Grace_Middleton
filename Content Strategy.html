  For this assignment I was required to review a recent multi-channel media campaign that failed and analyse why it happened and suggest improvements. 
  I choose a campaign in which taxi passengers were invited to share their personal taxi stories using the YourTaxis hashtag. The aim was to take on the popular ride-sharing service Uber. 
  However the campaign did not go as 
  planned with almost everyone responding with a negative story about catching a taxi. I then described the marketing strategy which was audience storytelling and how it completly backfired 
  because the marketing agency that came up with the idea were to niave in thinking that people hadn't had bad experiences in taxis. I then suggested an alternative campaign which was to <br>
  send out an email to customers who have subscribed to a mailing list. In the email their should be a question asking them to detail their positive experiences they’ve had using a taxi. <br>
  After this information has been collected it should be shortened into small sentences which can be turned into graphics for Instagram.

  For this assignment I was required to gather insights to inform a new Content Strategy for a brand called With Harper Lu. I firstly did some research about the brand values, tone of voice and 
  look and feel. I then came up with the demographics and psychographics to match. After that I researched who the competitors were and outlined what made them different to With Harper Lu. <br>
  I then did a cultural analysis about what is currently happening in the clothing market. I then created some goals for the business and aligned them with objectives that the content needed to 
  fulfill. I then decided what channels I wanted the content to appear on which included Tik Tok, Instagram and Email. I then created a content plan which included dates of when the content 
  needed to be posted, what channel it was going to be posted on, the strategy, the audience, the objective, the message and the call to action. After all of that had been done I then mocked up 
  the content for the specific platforms I had suggested and presented it.

  For this assignment I was required to create a media campaign for a brand called Francsesca Jewellery. I firstly did some background research on the brand including what types of products 
  they sell. I then came up with demographics to match. After that I researched some market insights for the fashion jewellery industry including market size and cosumer spending. After that I 
  researched competitors of Francsesca which included Zafino and Pandora. I then came up with the campaign idea for the brand which was Elevate With Francsesca. The campaign centred 
  around increasing brand awareness for new and existing customers with a focus on becoming a better version of yourself by taking the next step with Francsesca. I then decided that the platforms where I wanted the content to be were Instagram, Tik Tok and Email. After that I put together a content plan with information including dates, channels, media types, strategy, 
  audience, objective, content type, message, call to action and lastly metrics. After I'd collated all of this information I mocked up my content and presented it.
